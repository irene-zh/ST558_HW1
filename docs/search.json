    "text": "What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?\nThere are several differences between data scientists and statisticians. - Data scientists may use things other than the scientific method to analyze and interpret data.\n\nData scientists focus more on practical application of a combination of different disciplines.\nStatisticians focus on using established techniques such as hypothesis testing, typically in research.\n\nThere are also, however, several key similarities. - Both fields require a solid foundation of statistical knowledge - Both work involve working with and finding ways to interpret large amounts of data"

Statistics is a part of data science that I do not have as much fluency in. One of my goals for the certificate program is to better understand the statistical methods of data analysis so I have a more well-rounded understanding of the field as a whole.\n\n## [1] \"density\"\n## [1] \"list\"\n## List of 8\n##  $ x         : num [1:512] -0.656 -0.648 -0.64 -0.633 -0.625 ...\n##  $ y         : num [1:512] 0.00161 0.00178 0.00197 0.00217 0.00239 ...\n##  $ bw        : num 0.252\n##  $ n         : int 150\n##  $ old.coords: logi FALSE\n##  $ call      : language density.default(x = iris$Petal.Width)\n##  $ data.name : chr \"iris$Petal.Width\"\n##  $ has.na    : logi FALSE\n##  - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\""
